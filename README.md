**AI-Powered Intelligent Data Insight Assistant**

[DEMO](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MBBRHH31NupHdYC5r8fu5K3P7-_p5CA2/view?usp=drive_link)

DataSaarthi is an interactive and smart data companion designed to help users extract meaningful insights from raw datasets without requiring advanced technical knowledge. Born out of a state-level hackathon challenge, DataSaarthi blends automation, AI, and user-centric design to simplify data understanding, anomaly detection, and decision-making.

 🧠 Key Features

- **Automated Data Summary**  
  Generates descriptive analytics including missing values, column-wise stats, datatypes, and distributions.

- **Smart Anomaly Detection**  
  Uses clustering and statistical methods to flag outliers and inconsistencies in the data.

- **Interactive Visualizations**  
  Offers clean and easy-to-understand charts to explore trends, distributions, and correlations.

- **Insight Engine (AI-Driven)**  
  Extracts key patterns using ML techniques (e.g., K-Means clustering) and presents them in simple language.

- **Plug-and-Play Interface**  
  User-friendly upload and result flow, suitable for non-technical users such as business analysts, students, and researchers.
